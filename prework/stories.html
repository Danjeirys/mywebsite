        <p id="p1">Hello, you want to hang out? Yea? Thats great we gonna have a blast. What's that? You want to know more about me? Sure thing I can tell you about myself.Well first thing you need to know about me is that I love anime.I can go on and on all day when it comes to anime. As for hobbies I don't have many.I like to skate both as sport and a way clear my mind from all the technology I'm usually around throughout the day.But on days I don't have the energy to go skating, I stay home and draw,Anime sketches ofc.Whoa! I gotta get going, I got work to get done today. This was fun, i hope we can hangout again soon. Till then stay productive and positive. Oh one more thing if you interested in picking up a board to go skating with me sometime check out the video down below for a few suggestions.</p>
